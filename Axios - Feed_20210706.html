        <p class="summary-container">
            <span class="summary">A hacker group known as "Cozy Bear" associated with the Russian government breached the computer systems of the Republican National Committee last week in a massive ransomware attack, Bloomberg first reported.The big picture: The attack follows a separate Russia-based criminal group unleashing an attack that compromised the computer systems of at least 1,000 businesses. No connection has been established between the attacks.Details: It is unclear what, if any, information the Cozy Bear hackers found. Danielle Alvarez, the GOP communications director, released a statement saying that while it was informed by Microsoft that their systems may had been exposed, "no RNC data was accessed."Alvarez added that it "will continued to work with Microsoft, as well as federal law enforcement officials on this matter."An RNC spokesperson told Bloomberg it is investigating the situation and has already informed the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security. The hackers allegedly attacked Synnex, a California-based company that provides IT services. The RNC said it was aware of "few instances where outside actors have attempted to gain access, through Synnex, to customer applications within the Microsoft cloud environment," per Bloomberg.Zoom out: Cozy Bear, also known as APT 29, has been tied to the Russian foreign intelligence service and accused of breaching the Democratic National Committee in 2016 as well as carrying out a supply-chain cyberattack involving SolarWinds Corp., which infiltrated nine U.S. government agencies.</span>

            <span class="summary">It's not just the structural soundness of high rises that's being scrutinized after the Surfside calamity. The amateurish way many condos are governed is also being challenged.What they're saying: "Some economists argue that the U.S. and other countries made a mistake by going too heavily into condos ... in the decades after World War II," Peter Coy of Bloomberg Businessweek reports.Florida's strict building regulations for high rises "have been enforced unevenly by local governments, and sometimes not at all," the New York Times reports.In a warning that reflects the dynamics at the doomed Surfside high-rise, Bloomberg quotes a 2020 report called "Breaking Point," from the Foundation for Community Association Research:"[A]ssociation homeowners and boards often are focused on keeping regular assessments low and only investing in visible, immediate outcomes."Professor Evan McKenzie of the University of Illinois Chicago School of Law, a specialist in urban politics, told Bloomberg that aging condos are a "ticking time bomb."Go deeper: Read the "Breaking Point" report.</span>

        </h2>
        <p class="author-line"><i>By Oriana Gonzalez on Jul 6th, 2021 at 09:13 PM</i></p>
        <p class="summary-container">
            <span class="summary">President Biden on Tuesday announced the White House's latest plan to get more Americans vaccinated as inoculation numbers slow across the U.S.Why it matters: Biden said the highly transmissible Delta variant, first detected in India, is responsible for half of the coronavirus cases in the country, and is continuing to grow among the unvaccinated population.State of play: The president summarized a new strategy to increase vaccinations this summer:Increase targeted, community-by-community, door-to-door outreach to ensure that every person can easily access the vaccine and has all the necessary information on the virus and inoculations. Plan a "renewed emphasis" on getting the vaccine to more primary care doctors and other health care professionals, so that people get inoculated at their own doctor's office.Continued efforts to get vaccines to pediatricians and other providers who serve young people, so that those between the ages of 12 to 18 can get vaccinated "as they go for 'back to school' checks ups or get ready for [physical exams] they need for fall sports," Biden said.Continued effort to ensure vaccines are available for working Americans, making sure that employers have shots available at work, and are able to give paid time-off for employees.Deploy mobile clinic units across the country "to help people at special events, summer festivals, sporting events, as well as places of worship and wherever we can find people gathered," Biden noted.The president said the administration will mobilize "COVID-19 surge response teams," comprised of experts from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other government agencies. They will work in states that are having issues preventing, detecting and responding to the spread of the Delta variant. The big picture: Biden's remarks come two days after the Fourth of July, which he had initially set as a deadline to see 70% of the adult U.S. population vaccinated with at least one shot. Approximately 67% received at least one dose by the holiday. What he's saying: "Please get vaccinated now. It works, it’s free, it’s never been easier, and it's never been more important," Biden said."Do it now for yourself and the people you care about, for your neighborhood, for your country. It sounds corny, but it’s a patriotic thing to do."What to watch: Biden said by the end of the week, the U.S. will have hit the milestone of 160 million fully vaccinated Americans.</span>

            <span class="summary">Tropical Storm Elsa is nearing hurricane strength as it approaches Florida's west coast, where it is expected to bring heavy rain, strong winds and flooding, according to the National Hurricane Center.The state of play: The NHC says there is "danger of life-threatening inundation from rising water moving inland from the coastline" in Florida's west coast, which is now under a hurricane warning, from Bonita Beach to the Aucilla River, including Tampa Bay. The storm was packing maximum sustained winds of 70 mph about 95 miles northwest of Key West at 2 p.m. on Tuesday, per an NHC advisory.Cuba will experience heavy rainfall that could lead to flooding and mudslides.The NHC says it will become a hurricane before making landfall in Florida. What to watch: Elsa is expected to move near or over parts of Florida's west coast later today through tonight. It will reach the north Florida Gulf coast on Wednesday, the NHC notes."Mid to late week, heavy rainfall across coastal Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina and southeastern Virginia" may result in flooding, the NHC writes.

        <p class="summary-container">
            <span class="summary">The Department of Defense announced Tuesday it was canceling the massive cloud contract awarded to Microsoft in 2019, saying it "no longer meets its needs."Why it matters: The JEDI contract was the largest-ever of its kind, with an estimated value of roughly $10 billion over a 10-year stretch. The deal, initially intended to modernize the Pentagon's IT operations, was the subject of a drawn-out legal battle with Amazon and Microsoft.Amazon filed a lawsuit in 2019 claiming that former President Trump had a bias against CEO Jeff Bezos that influenced the Pentagon's decision to award the contract to Microsoft.The Pentagon reaffirmed its decision to award the contract to Microsoft in September 2020.What they're saying: "One contract has never, and will never, define our relationship with the DoD or any customer. Our decades-long partnership with the DoD will continue — and we stand ready to support our nation’s men and women in uniform as they address our national security needs," Microsoft said in a statement.What to watch: In a press release, the Pentagon said it is still seeking an enterprise-scale cloud capability and announced a new multivendor contract, which both Microsoft and Amazon will be asked to bid for. </span>

The departure came after nearly 20 years of using the facility as the center of its war to oust the Taliban and search for the al-Qaeda perpetrators of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.Worth noting: CENTCOM said it would no longer be updating specific percentage updates of its withdrawal, citing security concerns.Go deeper: Biden cuts off questions about Afghanistan amid growing Taliban concerns</span>

        <p class="summary-container">
            <span class="summary">Four more bodies have been pulled from the rubble of the collapsed condo in Surfside, Florida, bringing the death toll to 36, Miami-Dade Mayor Daniella Levine Cava said at a press briefing Tuesday afternoon.The latest: 29 of the 36 individuals who died have been identified. While 191 individuals have been accounted for, as many as 109 people remain "potentially unaccounted for," Levine Cava said.“We’re actively searching as aggressively as we can,” Miami-Dade County Fire Chief Alan Cominsky said at a news conference earlier Tuesday, per Associated Press. “Unfortunately, we are not seeing anything positive. The key things — void spaces, living spaces — we’re not seeing anything like that," he added.Eight people were pulled from the rubble Tuesday, the highest since the building collapsed on June 24, per AP. Rescuers worked through the night Monday amid strong wind and rain, temporarily halting search efforts at about 1am briefly when lightning struck close to the site.As the outer bands of Tropical Storm Elsa approach Surfside, crews are expecting windy and rainy conditions through much of the day. Surfside is not in Elsa's direct cone.Weather officials are embedded in Surfside to monitor Elsa's forecast, according to Levine Cava. "We're closely monitoring the weather, and we now have our weather service embedded within our search and rescue teams to work closely to track for any changes that could impact the work to assure the safety of our first responders," Levine Cava said.State of play: The search was paused over the weekend so that a controlled demolition could take down the remaining portion of the building, after officials raised concerns over dangers posed by the approaching storm.Rescuers have removed about 124 tons of debris from the site, Miami-Dade Fire Rescue chief Alan Cominsky said. At least six individuals involved in rescue efforts in Surfside have tested positive for COVID-19, the New York Times reports.Editor's note: This post has been updated with additional details. </span>

        </h2>
        <p class="author-line"><i>By Dan Primack on Jul 6th, 2021 at 03:03 PM</i></p>
        <p class="summary-container">
            <span class="summary">U.S. tech companies for years have grumbled about how the Chinese government favored its homegrown heroes, largely shielding them from global competition. Now, though, China is turning on its own Big Tech companies, reminding them who's boss.Why it matters: This complicates U.S. IPO plans for dozens of Chinese companies, and potentially revalues even more Chinese unicorns.Driving the news: China on Sunday banned DiDi from app stores, just days after the ride-hail giant went public on the NYSE at a $73 billion valuation.WSJ reports that Chinese regulators privately urged DiDi to delay its IPO, which the company neither did nor disclosed.Per WSJ: "Back in Beijing, officials, especially those at the Cyberspace Administration of China, remained wary of the ride-hailing company’s troves of data potentially falling into foreign hands as a result of greater public disclosure associated with a U.S. listing."DiDi shares were down more than 24% at this morning's market open, representing around $18 billion in lost market value.Chinese regulators also disclosed cybersecurity investigations into several other companies, including recent U.S. IPO issuer Full Truck Alliance, blocking them from registering new users.And there are new reports that Weibo (Nasdaq: WB) is considering a take-private plan amid the crackdown, although the social media company is saying it's untrue.Flashback: Chinese regulators successfully scuttled an IPO for Ant Financial late last year, just days before it was set to price, albeit for different official reasons.The big difference between then and now is that, by letting DiDi and others go public before bringing down the regulatory hammer, China is putting a chill on foreign investor interest in future Chinese tech IPOs. And lots of them are (or were?) expected to hit U.S. exchanges in the back half of 2021.The bottom line: What a government giveth, a government can taketh away. From both companies and its shareholders.</span>

        <p class="summary-container">
            <span class="summary">Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Nikole Hannah-Jones announced Tuesday that she will not be teaching at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill this fall, following a national controversy over an initial decision by the school's board of trustees not to offer her tenure.The state of play: Hannah-Jones, the creator of the New York Times' 1619 Project about the history of slavery and its lasting impact in the U.S., will be joining Howard University as the tenured Knight Chair in Race and Journalism. Award-winning writer Ta-Nehisi Coates will also join the faculty of the historically Black university.The big picture: Hannah-Jones and the 1619 Project have been heavily criticized by Republicans, who claim the essay contains historical inaccuracies and undermines patriotism. The project also drew considerable backlash from some prominent historians.In April, UNC's board of trustees set aside Hannah-Jones' tenure application despite recommendations from the school's faculty and administrators. The school announced that it would instead offer her a fixed five-year contract.The decision sparked backlash and a national controversy, with reports emerging that a prominent donor to UNC's journalism school had raised concerns about Hannah-Jones' academic credentials and impartiality.After weeks of public pressure and scrutiny, the board of trustees voted 9-4 in a closed session last week to grant Hannah-Jones tenure. She characterized the initial delay as politically motivated and said it amounted to "illegal discrimination."What they're saying: "I've spent my entire life proving that I belong in elite white spaces that were not built for Black people," Hannah-Jones said on CBS "This Morning," where she announced the decision."I got a lot of clarity through what happened with University of North Carolina. I decided I didn't want to do that anymore, that Black professionals should feel free, and actually perhaps an obligation to go to our own institutions and bring our talents and resources to our own institutions and help to build them up as well," she continued."This is not my fight. I fought the battle I wanted to fight. Which is I deserve to be treated equally and have a vote on my tenure. I won that battle. It's not my job to heal the University of North Carolina. That's the job of the people in power who created the situation."Faculty members of UNC's Hussman School of Journalism addressed Hannah-Jones' decision in an open letter on Tuesday, writing:While disappointed, we are not surprised. We support Ms. Hannah-Jones’s choice. The appalling treatment of one of our nation’s most-decorated journalists by her own alma mater was humiliating, inappropriate, and unjust.We will be frank: It was racist.Our school highly regards Ms. Hannah-Jones’s work, ability, and achievements. We regret that the top echelons of leadership at UNC-Chapel Hill failed to follow established processes, did not conduct themselves professionally and transparently, and created a crisis that shamed our institution, all because of Ms. Hannah-Jones’s honest accounting of America’s racial history. It is understandable why Ms. Hannah-Jones would take her brilliance elsewhere.Read the full letter.</span>

        </h2>
        <p class="author-line"><i>By Sam Ro on Jul 6th, 2021 at 12:25 PM</i></p>
        <p class="summary-container">
            <span class="summary">Data: U.S. Department of Labor and Wells Fargo Securities; Chart: Axios VisualsEmployers are doing what they have to do to address persistent labor shortages: They’re offering more money.Why it matters: The reopening of the U.S. economy is fueling demand for goods and services. But businesses have struggled to meet that demand because current pay rates aren’t attracting the qualified applicants that employers want.By the numbers: The June jobs report on Friday showed average hourly earnings were up 0.3% month over month in June.This continued growth is notable because it comes on top of a 0.4% gain in May and a 0.7% jump in April.On an annualized basis, the past three months of gains represent a 5.9% pace of growth, which is substantially higher than the 2.4% average from the last economic cycle, per Wells Fargo.What they’re saying: "Getting workers back to the job site has not come cheap," Wells Fargo senior economist Sarah House writes. "Employers have had to pony up in industries where shortages have been particularly acute."Lower-wage industries, like leisure, hospitality and retail, which combine to employ 30 million people, reported strong gains. Leisure, hospitality and retail accounted for 49% of the 850,000 jobs added in June.Yes, but: "There is still progress to be made," Indeed Hiring Lab's Nick Bunker writes in an email. "Employment in leisure and hospitality is still 12.9% below its pre-pandemic level."The 15.1% pace in leisure and hospitality "reflects the mismatch between demand and supply, which should be resolved over time, leaving wage growth to cool in this sector," says BofA head of U.S. economics' Michelle Meyer. "We would therefore squarely put this in the 'transitory' camp."All major industries are pacing above 3% — even higher-wage areas like information, financial, professional and business services.Morgan Stanley economist Robert Roesner notes that higher-wage industries have also struggled with record job openings and unusually high quit rates."The wage data is starting to show a transition from more idiosyncratic pressures to more broadly based and potentially more persistent pressures," Roesner writes. The bottom line: Businesses need to be able to sell stuff, but they can’t do it without workers. And as long as demand is outstripping supply, workers will continue to have leverage to ask for more money. </span>

"We know it's good for business to build out a platform that's about kindness, not in a saccharine way but in a bold way, and to support local businesses," she says.Friar added that top priorities are to grow the user base, develop products to to make the newsfeed feel more personal to users and build more tools to make it more useful for local businesses. In addition, there will be a focus on hiring and international expansion. Look ahead: When the proposed transaction closes, Nextdoor will be listed under ticker symbol "KIND."Investors: The deal includes a $270 million PIPE from such investors as T. Rowe Price, Baron Capital Group, Dragoneer, and Soroban Capital.Nextdoor had raised over $270 million from venture capitalists, most recently in late 2019 at a $2.2 billion valuation. Backers include Benchmark, Greylock, and Shasta Ventures.Friar was previously CFO of Square, where Khosla was an early and significant investor. Our thought bubble: Even with investors that are aligned with the social network's mission, being a public company comes with intense pressure to deliver on revenue and profit goals. It will be interesting to see if Nextdoor can maintain its "good guy" persona in the social media space. Go deeper: Nextdoor: The next big social network</span>

            <a class="title-link" href="link">The future of EV batteries could be found under the sea</a>
        </h2>

            <span class="summary">All the battery metals we need to power a billion electric vehicles could be lying on the floor of the Pacific Ocean — but collecting them and turning them into EV batteries is a major challenge. Why it matters: It's going to take a lot of batteries to replace the world's gasoline-powered cars with zero-emission EVs. And that will require digging more lithium, nickel, cobalt, copper and manganese out of the earth.Experts worry that mining's environmental threats could outweigh the benefits of increased renewable energy production. What's happening: The Metals Company of Vancouver claims it has identified a less damaging way to mine battery metals from ancient rocks resting on the seafloor.Context: Polymetallic nodules are metal-rich rocks formed slowly over millions of years as layers of iron and manganese hydroxides grew around a small shell or rock fragment. Many also contain nickel, copper and cobalt.One of the largest nodule deposits is the Clarion Clipperton Zone in the Pacific Ocean 1,000 miles west of Mexico and roughly 500 miles south of Hawaii — well outside any country's territory. Exploration rights to the underwater field are controlled by the International Seabed Authority, created in 1982 by the United Nations to ensure mining in international waters benefits all countries, not just wealthy ones.Through sponsorship deals with three tiny Pacific island nations vulnerable to climate change — Nauru, Tonga and Kiribati — The Metals Company secured exploration rights to approximately 150,000 square kilometers of the ISA-licensed seabed.Those sections alone contain estimated rock resources sufficient for 280 million EVs — a quarter of the total global passenger car fleet, says CEO Gerard Barron. "Mother Nature has done a great job putting all these amazing rocks in one place," he adds.How it works: A robotic collector — akin to a giant vacuum — skims designated areas of the seabed, sucking up polymetallic nodules lying amid a thin layer of sediment, before pumping them up to a production support vessel on the surface. The collected nodules are then transported to shore for further processing and refining.The other side: "Sending gigantic mining machines designed to bulldoze and churn up the seabed is clearly a very bad idea," according to a Greenpeace post.Deep-sea mining will damage sensitive and unique habitats, threatening sea creatures and disrupting the ocean food chain, the organization argues.The Metals Company sees it differently. The rocks are easily removed without blasting, drilling or excavating — traditional ore mining practices that cause deforestation and create toxic waste. "They're literally sitting there like golf balls on a driving range," said Barron.Microorganisms on the seabed are not destroyed, he said. Instead, they are "shaken up and carry on," he said.What's next: The company, founded in 2009 as Deep Green Metals, is going public via merger with a shell company called Sustainable Opportunities Acquisition Corporation. The SPAC deal puts the firm's value at $2.9 billion and will provide investment capital to begin pilot production by 2024, likely in Asia. Revenue from the pilot project will help fund a portion of the $7 billion the company will need to ramp up to full-scale production, which could begin in the United States by 2026, according to the company's public filings. The reality is that the clean energy transition is not possible without taking billions of tons of metal from the planet. Seafloor nodules offer a way to dramatically reduce the environmental bill of this extraction.Gerald Barron, The Metals Company  </span>

            <a class="title-link" href="link">The pandemic created boomerang-worker tech hubs — and they're not going away</a>
        </h2>

            <span class="summary">"Boomerang workers" — those who've returned to their hometowns to do remote work — rose with the pandemic, but the phenomenon shows signs of sticking around beyond it.The big picture: Workers typically have to move to where the jobs are, centralizing top talent in big coastal cities. But as COVID drove rapid adoption of remote work, many people who were able to opted to return to their roots to be closer to family, raise kids in familiar settings or simply escape big city life.What's happening: The boomerang effect isn't limited to any one industry. But tech workers in particular are choosing to leave big tech hubs like San Francisco, Seattle and New York and moving back to previous stops, or to their own hometown or a spouse’s. That’s jumpstarting tech communities in some mid-sized cities.For example, a large number of Tampa Bay natives have returned to the area after stints in bigger cities, bringing their contact lists and industry expertise with them. Allie Felix grew up in Tarpon Springs but left for venture capital jobs in San Francisco and New York. She moved back to join Embarc Collective, a startup and entrepreneur support hub in Tampa that launched in 2018.Whitney Holtzman, a Tampa native, honed her sports marketing skill in New York before returning to start her own business helping athletes grow their social media influence and reach. Of course, plenty of people moved back home for a variety of reasons well before the pandemic hit — but they often had to leave their jobs behind when they did. Now that more companies are allowing remote work, employees often have the freedom to take their jobs with them when they high-tail it home. Or they are starting their own businesses.“It’s very appealing for people to feel like they’re coming in on the ground floor” of a city’s tech scene, Lakshmi Shenoy, CEO of Embarc Collective. “They get to help build and shape it.”Yes, but: The remote work option alone isn’t always enough. Shenoy said the biggest questions people ask when thinking about moving back to the Tampa Bay Area are:Are there job opportunities in case the remote version of their current job doesn’t work out?Are there opportunities for their spouses?Are the schools good?Between the lines: Part of the boomerang was driven by newly remote workers moving back to be closer to their parents for help with child care. But even among those who saw it as a temporary move, many are opting to stay. And those who can't work remotely are simply looking for local jobs. "A lot of people moved toward their parents for child care, and a lot of that will stick. Family relationships changed during the pandemic," said Betsey Stevenson, a University of Michigan economist.In Tulsa, Okla., a program called Tulsa Remote offers people $10,000 to move to the city to work remotely. About 30% of those who've accepted the offer have lived in Tulsa or have a family connection to the city, said Ben Stewart, executive director of Tulsa Remote.The other side: There’s no guarantee for how much of the boomerang will last as cities and offices reopen. The number of people working from home is already on the decline, per data from Indeed, although the level is still several times higher than pre-pandemic levels.</span>

        </h2>

            <span class="summary">When Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson take flight aboard the rockets their companies built, the hopes and dreams of a burgeoning industry will be flying with them as well. Why it matters: Accidents or errors on these high-profile flights from Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin could derail their plans — and possibly affect others' plans — for commercial space tourism and travel. Driving the news: Last week, Virgin Galactic announced that it would push to fly Branson and others on a fully crewed test flight on July 11, just ahead of Blue Origin's first flight with Bezos, scheduled for July 20.There has been a low hum of animosity brewing between the two companies in public since it was revealed Bezos might fly before Branson.That rivalry spilled over last week after the Branson announcement, with Blue Origin CEO Bob Smith saying the two companies aren't after the same prize in these first flights.“We wish him a great and safe flight, but they’re not flying above the Karman line and it’s a very different experience,” Smith said of Branson and Virgin Galactic in a statement via the New York Times. (The Karman line is the unofficial altitude at which space begins, about 62 miles up.) The big picture: Launching and building satellites is a big moneymaker in the space industry, but suborbital space tourism is seen as a means of getting more people interested in the space industry in the long term. In theory, these flights should be more affordable and available to a large group of people who will only need to train for a day or two before going to the edge of space.If something were to go wrong with one of these high-profile, early flights, it could threaten the companies' business plans going forward and cast doubt on whether suborbital space tourism could serve as a boon for the rest of the industry.Flashback: An accident during a Virgin Galactic test flight in 2014 left one pilot dead. After the crash, Branson considered stopping development of the company's space plane altogether. Yes, but: The company did continue on, and public support for it has been steady. It's possible an accident from either of the companies wouldn't hurt public opinion of the endeavor as a whole.Depending on why an accident occurred, "I don't think you would see a mass exodus of Virgin Galactic reservation holders or a noticeable drop in interest in flying on Blue Origin," space historian Robert Pearlman said.What to watch: A major failure or problem could also put pressure on Congress to start pushing for more regulation of private human spaceflight, which some argue could stifle the space travel industry just as it is beginning.At the moment, the FAA is not allowed to regulate the safety of "spaceflight participants" — Bezos, Branson or anyone else who would fly on one of these vehicles — until at least 2023. Instead, the crews today fly under a regime known as "informed consent" where they must agree to and be told of the risks before launch.That moratorium on regulation was put in place in order to allow the industry to launch before restrictions were placed on it. </span>

            <span class="summary">New media personalities have gained enormous traction over the past year by catering to individuals who feel disillusioned by the mainstream press.Why it matters: A convergence of trends over the past year has made it easier for writers to launch new entities that can rival mainstream outlets and it's given these creators the freedom to criticize big media institutions.Trust in the mainstream media is at a record low, and the remote nature of the pandemic, sped up by digital innovation, is making it much easier for creators to self-publish and distribute their work online. "People are hungry for information, just not the information that the corporate media is trained to give people," Saagar Enjeti, co-host of the new YouTube show "Breaking Points," tells Axios. Driving the news: Enjeti and former MSNBC anchor and political candidate Krystal Ball recently left The Hill newspaper to start their own franchise on YouTube and via podcasts. "Breaking Points" has gained nearly half a million subscribers in one month. It ranks in the top 10 news podcasts on Apple Podcasts in the U.S., ahead of popular shows like NPR News Now and Pod Save America. It's the second-most popular podcast currently, behind Premiere Networks' Clay Travis and Buck Sexton, who replaced Rush Limbaugh earlier this year.The duo routinely takes aim at the mainstream media, sometimes using terms similar to those popularized during the Trump era, like the "fake news New York Times.""People weren't coming to it because it said 'The Hill' on the top," Enjeti recently noted, referring to their former show. "They were coming to it because they trusted us. And that is the thing — that's the keystone of the entire new media ecosystem."State of play: Pundits that have recently launched their own media ventures are running a similar playbook, selling their digital platforms — mostly newsletters, podcasts and YouTube shows — as antidotes to the institutional media. Glenn Greenwald, formerly of The Guardian and the co-founding editor of The Intercept, is a key example, as well as fellow Substack writers Matthew Yglesias, formerly of Vox Media, and Matt Taibbi. Greenwald and popular podcaster Joe Rogan have been vocal supporters of Enjeti and Ball, boosting their audience with Twitter support and media appearances.Support from the likes of Rogan can be a game changer for independent journalists. Rogan's wildly successful podcast can in part be attributed to his rebuke of the principles of mainstream journalism, including the "absence of curation, or any discernible editing," as the New York Times notes. "Rogan is the father of the space," Enjeti says. "He created the environment in which we could thrive. I truly believe I wouldn't be here today without him."Yes, but: Rogan, a comedian and UFC commentator, is the exception, not the rule. Many independent personalities that today criticize the mainstream press were able to build their new brands following lengthy careers in corporate media. Bari Weiss, a former New York Times opinion writer, wrote on her Substack blog in April, "The trust I build with you is based on getting things right. Not a fancy brand name.""There's an intimacy about so-called 'pushed content' — the newsletters and podcasts — that enhances trust in an era where trust is vanishing," says Steve Hayes, CEO and editor of The Dispatch, a center-right digital media company that launched on Substack in 2019. The Dispatch has more than 150,000 subscribers, with nearly 30,000 paying for content.By the numbers: Of the top 50 political podcasts on Apple podcasts today, about 60% come from personalities that don't work at mainstream news companies.  What to watch: Using new platforms to attack media companies may lead to continued polarization of audiences and the nation, Helen Lewis notes in the Atlantic. Most troubling, the trend could also lead to an increase in the perception that misinformation runs rampant and that audiences shouldn’t trust anything they see in the news.The bottom line: If necessity is the mother of invention, then corporate backlash is the mother of new media upstarts.Editor's note: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated that Glenn Greenwald was formerly with the Washington Post.</span>

        </h2>
        <p class="author-line"><i>By Russell Contreras on Jul 6th, 2021 at 10:00 AM</i></p>
        <p class="summary-container">
            <span class="summary">Efforts to recall school board members are surging around the U.S. — and especially in California — amid Republican efforts to quash teaching about institutional racism.Why it matters: Coordinated efforts by conservative groups  are shaping public education, fueled by controversies over race as as well as backlash to COVID-19 closures.The big picture: Just halfway through 2021, at least 51 local recall efforts involving K-12 school boards have been initiated this year, targeting at least 130 elected members of those boards.That's more than twice the annual average, according to Ballotpedia, a website that follows election trends. It's accompanying the surge of new school board candidates that Axios' Stef Kight has been tracking.By the numbers: California alone is home to 22 of the current recall efforts. Arizona and Idaho follow with six and four recall efforts respectively.By comparison, Ballotpedia counted a yearly average of 23 recall efforts against 52 school board members between 2006 and 2020.The intrigue: Historically, school board recalls tended to stem from disputes over mismanagement, open meeting violations or allegations of corruption. But this year's campaigns focus on efforts to snuff out teachings on critical race theory and displeasure about mask requirements. A political action committee led by former Trump Justice Department official Ian Prior is sponsoring a recall of school board members in Loudoun County, Virginia who belonged to a private Facebook group focused on anti-racism.Four of the seven members of the Mequon-Thiensville School District Board of Education in Wisconsin are being targeted over the district's response to the COVID-19 pandemic and introducing critical race theory lessons. Two of the five members of the Litchfield Elementary School District Governing Board in Arizona face a recall effort tied to objections about critical race theory.Reality check: Critical race theory — which holds that racism is baked into the formation of the nation and ingrained in our legal, financial and education systems — was developed in law schools in the 1970s and isn't really taught in grade school.But some teachers have endured criticism for merely mentioning systemic racism in class or bringing up Black Lives Matter protests following the death of George Floyd last year.Melissa Statz, a fourth-grade teacher in Wisconsin, last year was accused by some parents of "indoctrinating children" because she introduced lessons on racism. Her school was later hit with racist graffiti. Don't forget: Elementary school teachers, administrators, and college professors are facing fines, physical threats, and fear of firing as states pass bans to restrict critical race theory in public schools.Citizens for Renewing America, a group led by a White House budget director under former President Trump, offers activists model legislation to craft bans in their states.The proposed legislation says that equity, intersectionality, social justice, and "woke" terms are racist ideas and falsely claims that critical race theory teaches that "one race or sex is superior to another race or sex." Meanwhile, "Patriots for Delaware" in May endorsed five pro-school-reopening candidates for the state's elections, highlighting a local push to limit social justice discussions and defy mask mandates.And parents in Pennsylvania formed their own political action committee to support school board candidates running to keep kids in school in person.</span>

            <span class="summary">The FDA's approval of Alzheimer's treatment Aduhelm puts physicians in a difficult position: They hold the prescribing power over a drug that most say is unproven. But desperate patients and families may not know or care about the lack of evidence and will want the prescription anyway.What they're saying: "The public message has to be clear: This is not a cure, and it's not even clear this is going to make substantial changes to someone's disease course," said Sharon Brangman, an Alzheimer's expert and geriatrician at Upstate University Hospital in New York. By the numbers: Almost 90% of physicians disagree with the FDA's approval of Aduhelm, and roughly 80% said they will not prescribe it, according to a new Medscape survey of doctors.At a minimum, doctors believe the FDA's label for Aduhelm is too broad, and the drug should only be for patients who have mild dementia and who have gotten scans showing they have the sticky brain plaques that the drug removes, according to interviews with doctors.Yes, but: Patients and their family members have been asking about Aduhelm nonstop since the FDA approval.Brangman says her clinic is fielding visits and calls from 40-60 patients per day, and each patient is asking about the drug.Physicians worry that despite how much they educate people about Aduhelm's unproven benefit, risky side effects, and high price, people will push for the prescription."My mother-in-law has advanced Alzheimer's. Would I give her this medication? Absolutely not," said Marc Gordon, a neurologist and Alzheimer's researcher at Northwell Health in New York. "But will doctors sometimes feel like they're doing something against their better judgment to appease the wishes of patients and families? Probably."Gordon, who believes the drug's approval will lead to "unrealistic expectations," said one of his colleagues in a private neurology practice got "yelled at by a patient's family because they couldn't get the drug the next day."The other catch: Physicians and hospitals will have a major financial incentive to prescribe the drug.If Medicare covers Aduhelm, it will fall under Medicare Part B.Medicare adds a 6% markup for all Part B drugs, which has long created concerns that providers are prescribing higher-priced drugs to get higher add-on fees.Aduhelm has a list price of $56,000 per year, which would mean thousands of dollars per patient every year just in Medicare add-on fees.And since hospitals and private equity firms increasingly own neurology clinics, "health systems could see this as a new opportunity to bring in revenue and start advertising their memory care," said Joseph Ross, a Yale University physician and researcher who has criticized Aduhelm's approval.The bottom line: "[Aduhelm] puts physicians in a much more challenging role of walking patients through what to expect," Ross said.Go deeper: New Alzheimer's drug is a catastrophe in the making</span>
